## Project Description
According to the README, this is intended to be an AI-powered 3D e-commerce platform, but no code has been implemented yet.

## Next Steps
The project needs to be built from scratch. Key components that would typically be needed for an AI-powered 3D e-commerce platform:
- Frontend (likely React/Next.js or similar for 3D rendering)
- Backend API (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Database for products and user data
- AI integration (for recommendations, search, etc.)
- 3D rendering library (Three.js, React Three Fiber, etc.)
- E-commerce functionality (cart, checkout, payments)

## Architecture
To be determined based on implementation requirements.
